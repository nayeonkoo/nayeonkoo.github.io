                "We are excited to have Nicole and Natalia join our Carolina family," Mann said. "They have been on our radar for quite some time and it has been impressive to see their development and growth over the last several years. Both individuals have a tremendous amount of tournament experience competing against the top amateurs in the world. As proven winners, we are confident that they will make an immediate impact on the success of our program. We look forward to Nicole and Natalia being great representatives of our team not only on the golf course but also in the classroom.”

    <!-- NECESSARY <script> LINKS. The three <script> links below add jQuery, popper.js, and Bootstrap 4 JavaScript. These are libraries of scripts that are necessary to make Bootstrap's interactive and animated components work (e.g., dropdown menus, buttons, alerts, carousels, collapsing navbars and content areas, modals, popups, tooltips, etc). These three <script> links MUST appear in THIS ORDER; this is because both popper.js and the Bootstrap scripts rely on jQuery to work, so jQuery must load into your page first. We add these links at the bottom of the <body> element instead of in the <head> element so the scripts won't be loaded into your site until they're needed, which helps with your site's speed and functionality. -->
